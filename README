MultiTGB is an open source (GPLv2) GB/GBC emulator with 4-player-adapter (dmg07) link cable support.

This is a fork of the TGB Dual libreto port.

At the moment only Yoshi's Cookie is playable with 4 players.
I'm looking for help to get more games working.

Thanks to Shonumi for doing the research, documentation and inspiration for this project.

You can emulate up to 4 Gameboy via split screen (change in the core-options):
- real multiplayer 4 player adapter emulation (only Yoshi’s cookie working)
- 2x 2-player link cable
- simultaneous 4 Single-Player without link-cable Emulation (Speedrun challenge ;D )

Goals:
- get DMG07-Emulation right so that every multiplayer game is working
- if that the case, create a GB Studio template to create new games with 4 Player Support
- create or find someone to create a 4-Player shader like the GB2Player Duimon Mega Bezel
- improve performance (multithreading) and clean the code
- get netplay working and testing
- maybe more Pokémon-feature...
