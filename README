DoubleCherryGB is an open source (GPLv2) GB/GBC emulator with 4 Player support, based on the TGBDual libretro core by GIGO and Hii.

It emulates the GAMEBOY 4 PLAYER ADAPTER (DMG-07) and also adds 4 Player Link Hacks.

See my [website](https://timoelrichs.is-a.dev) for more information and compatibility list.

### Features

- DMG-07 Emulation
- Tetris 4Player Hack

Currently only for local multiplayer. I want to support netplay in a future release.

### How to

Download the core from the github release page. 
This is an early pre-alpha. I want to add the core to the official Libretro infrastructure soon.

To emulate up to four units, use the core options in your frontend.  

Thanks to
- Shonumi for doing the research and documentation on the dmg-07  https://shonumi.github.io/index.html
- GIGO and Hii for making TGBDual and zhe libretro port
